# Title: Exciting the Spin Transitions of 167 Er:CaWO4 with Propagating Microwaves via Superconducting Electrical Circuits

### A documentation of my thesis on the topic Spin Relaxation Dynamics of Er:CaWO4 measured at Sub-Kelvin Temperatures. 
Repository contains the final draft of the thesis along with the latex template. See HaydenTanis_BSc_Thesis for final manuscript and the zip file for latex.
It serves as a record of the research process and a documentation of Hayden's work.


Several MATLAB scripts are uploaded to the folder "Scripts". 

Presentation slides are included.
